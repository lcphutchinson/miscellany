# The Miscellany Repo

As the title might suggest, this repository holds modules with no associated projects or products. Mostly, this is a space for me to practice old skills or incorporate new ones in a low-commitment environment, while maintaining some record of productivity (as I'm likely slacking on Game Lieutenant or some other large project)
